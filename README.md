# VisualCSharpSnippets
Common C# snippets for faster coding

Just pull these down and copy them to this directory: 
C:\Users\jbarneck\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Code Snippets\Visual C#\My Code Snippets

Alternately, you could copy them to this directory, but if you did that, then some would overwrite existing snippets:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC#\Snippets\1033\Visual C#
